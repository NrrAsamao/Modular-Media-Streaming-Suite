OVERVIEW

The Java media playback framework is a modular system that separates content sources from rendering engines, supports multiple protocols, and allows dynamic feature enhancement through decorator patterns. It features built-in caching, hardware acceleration, and hierarchical playlists, making it a flexible foundation for scalable media applications.

System Components

1. Core Interface

    MediaSource → Media open(String mediaId)
    Renderer    → void render(Media media)
    Media       → String getId(), getUri()

2. Media Source

   LocalFileSource     → file:///local/{id}.mp4
    HLSStreamSource     → https://stream.example.com/{id}.m3u8  
    RemoteAPISource     → https://api.media.com/media/{id}/stream
    CachingMediaSource  → Proxy with LRU caching
   
4. Rendering (Playback)

   SoftwareRenderer → CPU-based decoding
   HardwareRenderer → GPU-accelerated decoding
   
6. Features Enhancement (Decorators)

   SubtitleDecorator       →  Subtitle track management
   WatermarkingDecorator   →  Visual watermark overlay  
   AudioEqualizerDecorator →  10-band audio equalizer
   
8. Playlist Management

   Playlist          →  Simple linear playlists
   CompositePlaylist →  Hierarchical nested playlists
   
10. Controler
    
    PlaybackController →  Main coordinator
    EnhancedDemo       →  Comprehensive demonstration
