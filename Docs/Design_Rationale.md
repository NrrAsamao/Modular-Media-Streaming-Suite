# Design Rationale: Patterns Used and Why

## Overview
This document explains the design patterns implemented in the Modular Media Streaming System, their locations, and the rationale behind each choice. The system demonstrates sophisticated software engineering through strategic pattern application.

---

## 1. Decorator Pattern ⭐

### **Where Used:**
- `RendererDecorator` (abstract base)
- `SubtitleDecorator`, `WatermarkingDecorator`, `AudioEqualizerDecorator` (concrete decorators)
- Applied to the `Renderer` interface

### **Why This Pattern:**
The Decorator Pattern was chosen because media rendering requires **dynamic feature composition**. Users need different combinations of features (subtitles, watermarks, audio processing) that can be mixed and matched at runtime.

**Benefits:**
- **Runtime Flexibility**: Features can be added/removed without code changes
- **Single Responsibility**: Each decorator handles one specific concern
- **Composability**: Multiple decorators can be chained together
- **Open/Closed Principle**: New decorators can be added without modifying existing code

**Example Usage:**
```java
Renderer enhanced = new WatermarkingDecorator(
    new AudioEqualizerDecorator(
        new SubtitleDecorator(
            new HardwareRenderer()
        )
    )
);
```

## 2. Composite Pattern ⭐

### **Where Used:**
- `CompositePlaylist` class
- Applied to playlist management for hierarchical structures

### **Why This Pattern:**
Media collections often have **hierarchical organization** (playlists within playlists, albums within genres). The Composite Pattern allows treating individual media items and collections uniformly.

**Benefits:**
- **Uniform Interface**: Same operations work on individual items and collections
- **Recursive Structure**: Natural representation of nested playlists
- **Simplified Client Code**: No need to distinguish between individual and composite objects
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new types of media containers

**Example Usage:**
```java
CompositePlaylist mainPlaylist = new CompositePlaylist("Music Library");
mainPlaylist.addPlaylist(rockPlaylist);  // Adding a playlist
mainPlaylist.addMedia("song.mp3");       // Adding individual media
```

## 3. Facade Pattern ⭐

### **Where Used:**
- `PlaybackController` class
- Acts as facade for the entire media streaming subsystem

### **Why This Pattern:**
The media streaming system has **complex interactions** between multiple components (sources, renderers, decorators). The Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface that hides this complexity.

**Benefits:**
- **Simplified Interface**: Single entry point for complex operations
- **Decoupling**: Clients don't need to know about subsystem details
- **Centralized Control**: All playback logic in one place
- **Easier Testing**: Mock the facade instead of multiple components

**Example Usage:**
```java
// Simple client usage - complexity hidden
PlaybackController controller = new PlaybackController(source, renderer);
controller.play("media.mp4");  // One method call handles everything
```

---

## 4. Adapter Pattern ⭐

### **Where Used:**
- `CachingMediaSource` class
- Wraps existing `MediaSource` implementations

### **Why This Pattern:**
Performance optimization through caching was needed, but **existing media sources shouldn't be modified**. The Adapter Pattern allows adding caching functionality transparently.

**Benefits:**
- **Transparent Enhancement**: Caching added without changing original sources
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work
- **Performance Boost**: Automatic caching with configurable limits
- **Flexible Wrapping**: Any media source can be cached

**Example Usage:**
```java
MediaSource original = new RemoteAPISource("api.com");
MediaSource cached = new CachingMediaSource(original, 100);  // Adds caching
```

---

## 5. Template Method Pattern ⭐

### **Where Used:**
- `RendererDecorator` abstract class
- Provides common structure for all decorators

### **Why This Pattern:**
All decorators share **common behavior** (like hardware acceleration support) but need **customizable rendering logic**. Template Method provides the structure while allowing customization.

**Benefits:**
- **Code Reuse**: Common decorator behavior in one place
- **Consistent Interface**: All decorators behave similarly
- **Flexible Customization**: Each decorator can override specific methods
- **Maintainability**: Changes to common behavior affect all decorators

**Example Usage:**
```java
public abstract class RendererDecorator implements Renderer {
    // Common implementation
    public boolean supportsHardwareAcceleration() {
        return wrapped.supportsHardwareAcceleration();
    }
    
    // Customizable implementation
    public abstract void render(Media media);
}
```

---

## 6. Strategy Pattern (Implicit)

### **Where Used:**
- `MediaSource` interface with multiple implementations
- `Renderer` interface with different rendering strategies

### **Why This Pattern:**
The system needs **multiple algorithms** for media retrieval and rendering. Strategy Pattern allows **runtime switching** between different approaches.

**Benefits:**
- **Algorithm Flexibility**: Easy to switch between sources/renderers
- **Runtime Configuration**: Different strategies for different scenarios
- **Extensibility**: New strategies can be added easily
- **Testability**: Each strategy can be tested independently

**Example Usage:**
```java
// Runtime strategy switching
controller.setRenderer(new HardwareRenderer());  // For performance
controller.setRenderer(new SoftwareRenderer());  // For compatibility
```

---

## Pattern Interaction and Synergy

### **Decorator + Facade:**
The Facade (`PlaybackController`) orchestrates Decorator chains, providing a simple interface for complex decorator compositions.

### **Composite + Facade:**
The Facade can work with Composite playlists, treating them uniformly through the same interface.

### **Adapter + Strategy:**
Adapters can wrap different strategies, adding functionality while maintaining the same interface.

### **Template Method + Decorator:**
Template Method provides the structure for Decorators, ensuring consistent behavior across all decorator implementations.

## Design Principles Applied

### **Single Responsibility Principle:**
Each pattern addresses a specific concern:
- Decorator: Feature addition
- Composite: Hierarchical organization
- Facade: Interface simplification
- Adapter: Interface adaptation

### **Open/Closed Principle:**
- Decorators: Open for new decorators, closed for modification
- Composite: Open for new container types
- Adapter: Open for new adaptations

### **Dependency Inversion:**
- Facade depends on abstractions (`MediaSource`, `Renderer`)
- Decorators depend on `Renderer` abstraction
- Adapters depend on `MediaSource` abstraction

### **Interface Segregation:**
- Small, focused interfaces (`Media`, `Renderer`)
- Clients depend only on what they use
- No unnecessary dependencies
